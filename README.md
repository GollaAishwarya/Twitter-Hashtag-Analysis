# Twitter-Hashtag-Analysis
The Twitter Hashtag Analysis project is a group project designed to analyze and visualize trending hashtags and related tweets in real time.
The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from Twitter data by performing sentiment analysis, frequency analysis, and generating visual reports.
The system uses Python for data processing, Tweepy for Twitter API integration, and Matplotlib, Seaborn, and WordCloud for data visualization.

The project is equipped with several key features, including real-time tweet extraction based on specific hashtags, 
sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral), and the generation of visual reports such as bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds.
The application provides a clear and concise analysis of public sentiment, making it valuable for brand monitoring, trend analysis, and social media insights.
